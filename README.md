# SymRCM: Reverse Cuthill-McKee node-renumbering algorithm for sparse matrices.

`SymRCM` is a tiny package for computing the Reverse Cuthill-McKee node permutation from a sparse matrix. The goal is to minimize the "profile" of the matrix, usually aimed at reducing the cost of LDLT or Choleski factorizations.

## Get SymRCM

This package is  registered, and hence one can do just
```julia
] add SymRCM
```
Only version 1.x and the nightly builds of Julia are supported.

## Testing

```julia
] test SymRCM
```

## Usage

For a sparse matrix `A` the basic usage is:
```julia
p = symrcm(A)
```
To solve the system of linear algebraic equations `x = A * b` with renumbering one can do
```
using SparseArrays
using LinearAlgebra
n = 7;
A = sprand(n, n, 1/n)
A = A + A' + 1.0 * I
A = sparse(A)
b = rand(n)
using SymRCM
p = symrcm(A)
ip = similar(p) # inverse permutation
ip[p] = 1:length(p)
xp = A[p, p] \ b[p] # solution to the renumbered system of equations
x = xp[ip] # solution to the original system of equations
A \ b # this is the direct solution which should be identical to the above
```

Lower-level functions may also be useful. The adjacency graph and the node degrees may be calculated as
```
ag = adjgraph(A; sortbydeg = true)
nd = nodedegrees(ag)
```
which can be used to compute the renumbering as
```
numbering1 = symrcm(ag, nd) # using the lower-level functions
numbering2 = symrcm(A) # direct use of the sparse matrix
```
and these two will be identical.

For significantly populated matrices the sorting of the neighbor lists
may be a significant expense. In that case the sorting may be turned off.
```
p = symrcm(A; sortbydeg = false) # note the keyword argument
```
Very often the resulting permutation is as good  as if the lists were sorted.
